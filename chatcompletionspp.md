it's quite complex
does it make sense to do all /chat/completions in DOs?
lets go back to the drawing board first and see what i want exactly.
addressable-in-stream, storable, priced
also if i'd add tools support and MCP (and context?), what would that do to adressability? this is difficult

deterministic from input isn't even needed per se. what's important is that you end up at the right URL, and you can just refresh.

also how does the Agent library fit into all of this?

also the hierarchical markdown output from mcp use in /chat/completions
