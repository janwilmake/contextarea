# `/chat/completions` and `/mcp`

- ✅ Turn letmeprompt into oauth-provided `/chat/completion` endpoint with models (chance to not niche down too much and build flaredream chat with little complexity!)
- ✅ Turn `letmeprompt.com/{id}/chat/completions` into the same thing, but with predetermined system prompt that is someone elses prompt
- ✅ Every url can be a basePath for the OpenAI SDK (as long as POST `*/chat/completions` is given, proxy with system prompt being set to context + prompt). Model value should follow the same allowed values as what I have now.
- ✅ Look up `store:true` behavior in openai and x-ai. is it useful to leave it? (NO)
- ✅ Add `store:true` behavior, removing that parameter from body, and storing the result in lmpify
- ✅ Incase of `store:true` ensure the response id is the URL we store it at
- ❌ Optional: add `resultUrl` in the same objects
- ✅ Create openapi for all of LMPIFY for programmatic use (leaving out html stuff)
- ✅ Test anthropic model via https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/openai-sdk - got model not found error
- ✅ In the UI, show 'Use as API' in footer which shows how to use the API.
- ✅ Endpoint `[/{id}]/mcp` that turns chat completion into an MCP tool.

I can now already turn https://flaredream.com/system.md into an MCP. It MUST OAuth the user in via Stripe. WORTH A HUGE POST.

# MCP Use

- Look how openai `/responses` responds with MCP stuff in stream and in normal. We probably need to turn the MCP into tools and call them ourselves
- Ability to configure MCP URL and perform OAuth from within UI where it stores auth on a per-url basis into localStorage. This requires making a POC first (possibly with dynamic client registration etc)
- Ability to configure mcp tools in /chat/completions with X-MCP-Authorization in header
- Do MCP run results get public too even for authenticated tools? I think it'd be great!

This is gonna be the single biggest useful usecase!

First MCPs I want:

- **Iterate Agent** `deploy` tool at the end: `deploy.flaredream.com/download.flaredream.com/id` for Flaredreams initial generation, using `deploy` tool after it's done (deploy tool must have access to intermediate result)
- **Feedback agent** for Testing a flaredream deployment (`test(evaloncloudID,request,criteria)=>feedback` tool that processes request into feedback, and `final_feedback(feedback, replace_feedback:boolean, status: "ok"|"fail"|"retry")` will end the agent)

This is a great first milestone having the 2 MCPs separately. With this I can verify manually if this works. After that, a looping agent can use both in a loop!

Building Agent-Friendly Monetization layer on HTTP level.

# New Monaco-based Contextarea

Instead of contextarea, i want monaco in the left one, with intellisense on URLs, autocomplete when writing new urls, and squiggly lines appearing dynamically to make suggestions, while editing.

# UX

It seems that the UI doesn't always properly handle errors. E.g. when claude is down sometimes, I'm getting just a blank screen, rather than a red error.

The model is always selected on whatever we had in localStorage, but it's better to set it to the configured value.

# Improved Usability & Benchmark For Workers

https://deploy.flaredream.com/https://uithub.com/janwilmake/xymake.profile didn't see route in `wrangler.toml`. Need perfect wrangler parsing!

In https://letmeprompt.com/httpspastebincon-ujmnhs0, `/api/stats` returns a 409 and doesn't log any error. Code seems fine. Let's try locally and see what's up.

Lot of generated things return errors. Tail worker often gets exception

Landingpage flaredream.com should retrieve all `featured:true` from benchmark and render them with 'view'

# With-money refactor (Dependency)

Check `withMoney` again and see what context would be needed to do a drop-in replacement with that from what i have now

Replace Stripeflare with X Money (more reliable for all users, allows to see who created something with nice X profile pic, etc)

https://github.com/janwilmake/with-money

To simplify, let's also just require login; ideally after filling first prompt (Should temporarily store prompt in cookie).

Ensure it doesn't logout quickly.

This would also allow getting an API KEY and more securely deposit lots of cash. To easily to build against LMPIFY with XYTEXT. also will allow closed-loop monetary system between creators and generations of these prompts, etc.

# Proper way to let REPO-OWNERS pay for generations, not users.

🤔 Ultimately I'd want to be able to set worker-name, repo-name, branch, and have these deployments happen automatically, instantly. For this to work, I require `Login with Cloudflare` and `Login with GitHub` to be a part of letmeprompt.com, and allow for generation-configs (name, repo, branch, worker-name). It's not clear to me yet if this should be a completely new app that uses letmeprompt.com? Maybe better; niched towards easy workers: flaredream!

The UI here is not nice: https://github.com/eastlondoner/vibe-tools

- it leads to use a bad model
- people may hit a ratelimit very quickly

What I'd want is a custom link that redirects to the cached response, e.g. https://contextjson.com/{owner}/{repo}/tree/{branch}/context/{id}. This should:

1. Check the `context.json` in the raw githubusercontent file
2. Generate uithub URL+prompt
3. With MY OWN API KEY (AND COST), call `POST https://letmeprompt.com/chat/completions` with preset model (if url/prompt didn't change, result should be cached). Also, result should include `X-Result-URL` header.
4. Redirect user to `X-Result-URL` where the result is being streamed to, paid for them.

After I have this, remove cheaper, smaller models; definitely discourage them. I can allow a budget of up to $5 free for anyone that puts a `context.json` file in their repo, but also should already have a way to see who's using it in a dashboard, and reach out to them easily.
