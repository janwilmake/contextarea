## Patchlink Plugin

IDEA: Help the idea guys with making their content more actionable

I basically created a 'mirror thread' and this could possibly be automated if lmpify had an MCP: https://x.com/janwilmake/status/1925218363774570938. But even if it's not automated it could be a great way to make ideas more actionable right away.

To truly optimise for actionability, it'd make a ton of sense to add 'patch for github' as a button, which would send the repo + result to the patch-api, which would basically be an independent glue. I can even charge a dollar for this instead since a lot of people don't know git, nor MCP.

The button should lead to this, and this should request permission to github oauth, then fork and patch, then redirect there! https://patch.forgithub.com/prepare?markdown={URL}&sourceOwner={OWNER}&sourceRepo={REPO}&sourceBranch={BRANCH}

This patch could also add the original lmpify that lead to the fork into the README, creating another viral loop! Besides, based on which boilerplate it is, it should add buttons to deploy (deploy to vercel, deploy to cloudflare, etc) so it's just one more click away from deployment.

The way the plugin system could work is by creating a **simple URL regex** that gets applied on the URLs in the prompt. For this patchlink to appear, the input prompt should have https://uithub.com/janwilmake/gists/tree/main/named-codeblocks.md

Add transformation to patcher:

- Ability inject HTML scripts
- Ability to inject buttons into README

Dream it --> Prompt it --> Ship it; flaredream!

**ðŸ¤¯ Brainstorm**: what if I had a generic worker that rendered HTML that executes a js-only worker script in-browser to then write the resulting HTML to the browser? This would be a way to achieve instant backends, safely. All that'd be needed would be to serve the right script on the right subdomain (proper separation), and write env secrets to localStorage with a wrapper script, before running the script. Now it basically allows eval! https://github.com/janwilmake/metaworker

## Worker Creator Plugin

If context includes https://uithub.com/janwilmake/gists/tree/main/cloudflare-worker-system-prompt.md

Then submit result after it's done to https://aidreamworker.com/put. This would:

1. run `mdapply` to get the files
2. transform the files; every static asset gets scripts injected if not already. the static assets get served at subdomain
3. for when asset is not hit, main.ts gets hit, which is a worker.
4. the scripts ensure that you can easily retrieve all files and write it to a repo if you like the result, but you can also go back in and edit the worker from there as you can one-click to lmpify.

If the system prompt is instructed to already know the URL, it can start typing this, making it already clickable before deployment. we could put a loadingscreen here or something.

I really should get to this! Even a very simple version that doesn't support any KV stuff, just binds the DOs, is already super powerful. It would mean things are full circle!
