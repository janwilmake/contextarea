# ExtExe - The AI Compilation Layer for Natural Language Programming

> Archived - Moved to [nlang](https://nlang.dev)

We can call this ExtExe: short for 'Extension Execution'. ExtExe.com is bought.

Description: extexe is an AI Layer capable of tranforming hierarchical files into AI-generated static assets and scripts.

Goals:

- Extensions can be stacked to recursively generate derivatives from a (natural language) source.
- Keep track of dependencies between files to calculate the most efficient way of generating
- Keep track of what's been generated and what hasn't yet, with a notion of what needs to be lazy and what needs to be proactively generated. Also keep track of what needs to be re-generated when a new update comes to the source-text.
- When having a "lazy strategy", have the ability to generate and serve static files in realtime using a "generative fallback" while keeping these assets ready for the next deployment to be truly static.
- Full flexibility in choosing generation configuration (LLM and prompts) using a github template repo.
- Doing this as fast, efficient, and cheap as possible.
- Clear distinction between source 'routes' and destination 'asset paths'

Much of the above has already been implemented in iRFC-cloud, albeit using a not-so-scalable vector database, and a custom root handler as source of truth, there is not much to be added.

The interface we want is as follows:

- input:
  - github (or other) repo-branch
  - optional: a previous successful deployment date from same source to same destination
- preprocessing:
  - get files
  - calculate diff
- internal:
  - prepare file data
  - calculate workflow
  - execute workflow
- output:
  - a file object of static files for the destination
  - a lazy fallback URL (can be inside of a config file)
- post-processing:
  - submit this new output to a repo/branch on github or similar or into a zip or r2 storage object. we now just need an uithub URL as response

The beauty is that, including the pre and post-processing steps, it's a URL-to-URL function now.

The output is to be used in a way where we:

- layover the template
- add lazily generated files from r2
- bundle to a worker executable
- (re)deploy.

TODO:

- âœ… Start with iRFC cloud and extract as much as we can use. See `syncBranch`, `irfc-admin/deploy`, `set` for the main blocks
- âœ… implement uithub compare, push, issues, discussions, pulls, and PR creation.
- âœ… Created a new OpenAPI that follows the filetransformers standard
- âœ… Created fileoverlay.com so we don't need to add that into extexe anymore.
- ðŸŸ  Implement chatcompletions.com so we have graceful cached chatcompletions
- ðŸŸ  Implement extexe without intermediate storages that resolves a file object to a new file object + diff
